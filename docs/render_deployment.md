# BantayKalusugan Render Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying the application on Render with a separate backend Web Service and a frontend Static Site. Your database can stay on Neon PostgreSQL, or you can move it to Render PostgreSQL if you prefer one provider.
This guide covers deploying the application on Render with a separate backend Web Service and a frontend Static Site. Your database can stay on Neon PostgreSQL, or you can move it to Render PostgreSQL if you prefer one provider.

## What gets deployed where

- Backend: FastAPI application in `backend/`
- Frontend: React/Vite app in `frontend/`
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL or Render PostgreSQL
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL or Render PostgreSQL
- Optional integrations: Azure OCR/blob storage and Twilio SMS

## Current readiness

The repository is deployable on Render, but it still needs the Render-specific environment variables configured correctly:

- The backend CORS allowlist must include your Render frontend URL.
- The frontend must point to the deployed backend URL through `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
- Database migrations must be applied after whichever Postgres database you use is reachable.

## Render YAML and deployment as code

`render.yaml` is Render's blueprint file. It lets you define services, build commands, start commands, pre-deploy migrations, rewrite routes, and environment variables in git instead of clicking through the dashboard every time.

A starter blueprint is included at the repository root as [render.yaml](../render.yaml). It is wired for this project’s backend Web Service and frontend Static Site.

Is it easier? Usually yes, if you want repeatable deployments, team consistency, or a clean way to recreate the stack later. It is slightly more work the first time, but it removes manual setup drift.

For this project, `render.yaml` would typically define:

- the FastAPI backend web service
- the React frontend static site
- the backend pre-deploy migration step (`alembic upgrade head`)
- the frontend rewrite route for React Router refreshes
- environment variable placeholders for `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, and the optional Azure/Twilio settings

If you keep using Neon, you do not need a Render database resource in the blueprint. You would still set `DATABASE_URL` to the Neon connection string.

If you want a fully Render-managed stack, you can create a Render PostgreSQL database and attach it instead.
- Database migrations must be applied after whichever Postgres database you use is reachable.

## 1. Choose your database

You do not need a Render database if you already have Neon.

Use Neon if:

- you already have a working Neon database
- you want to avoid migrating data to another provider
- you want to keep the database separate from the hosting provider

Use Render PostgreSQL if:

- you want everything managed inside Render
- you want a one-provider setup
- you prefer Render to handle the database provisioning lifecycle

### If you keep Neon

1. Keep your Neon connection string handy.
2. Set `DATABASE_URL` on the backend service to the Neon string.
3. Run migrations against Neon with `alembic upgrade head`.

### If you use Render PostgreSQL
## 1. Choose your database

You do not need a Render database if you already have Neon.

Use Neon if:

- you already have a working Neon database
- you want to avoid migrating data to another provider
- you want to keep the database separate from the hosting provider

Use Render PostgreSQL if:

- you want everything managed inside Render
- you want a one-provider setup
- you prefer Render to handle the database provisioning lifecycle

### If you keep Neon

1. Keep your Neon connection string handy.
2. Set `DATABASE_URL` on the backend service to the Neon string.
3. Run migrations against Neon with `alembic upgrade head`.

### If you use Render PostgreSQL

1. Log in to Render.
2. Create a new PostgreSQL database.
3. Choose a name for the database and wait for provisioning to finish.
4. Copy the internal or external database connection string.

## 2. Deploy the backend

1. In Render, create a new **Web Service**.
2. Connect the GitHub repository that contains this project.
3. Set the **Root Directory** to `backend`.
4. Set the runtime to **Python**.
5. Use this build command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Use this start command:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

7. Add these environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL` - the connection string from Neon or Render PostgreSQL
- `DATABASE_URL` - the connection string from Neon or Render PostgreSQL
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY` - a strong random secret
- `FRONTEND_ORIGINS` - your frontend URL on Render, for example `https://your-frontend.onrender.com`
- `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` - required only if you use OCR blob uploads
- `AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME` - optional, defaults to `documents`
- `AZURE_OCR_ENDPOINT` - required only if you use Azure Document Intelligence
- `AZURE_OCR_KEY` - required only if you use Azure Document Intelligence
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` - required only if you use SMS
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` - required only if you use SMS
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` - required only if you use SMS with a direct phone sender
- `TWILIO_MESSAGING_SERVICE_SID` - optional if you use a Twilio Messaging Service

8. Deploy the service.
9. Open the backend URL and confirm the root route responds.

## 3. Run migrations on the backend database

After the backend service is created, apply Alembic migrations so the database matches the code:

```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

If you are using the Render shell or a deploy hook, run the command from the `backend` directory context.

If you are keeping Neon, point the command at the Neon-backed deployment environment. The migration step is the same; only the database URL differs.

### Free-tier migration note

On Render's Free web service plan, you should not rely on one-off jobs or SSH access, because those features are not available on free web services. The free-friendly way to run Alembic on Render is to keep the backend service's `preDeployCommand` set to `alembic upgrade head`.

That means every deploy runs the migration automatically before the FastAPI app starts. In this repo, the starter [render.yaml](../render.yaml) already includes that command.

If you prefer to run the migration manually, do it from your local machine against the same `DATABASE_URL` that Render uses.

## 4. Deploy the frontend

1. In Render, create a new **Static Site**.
2. Connect the same GitHub repository.
3. Set the **Root Directory** to `frontend`.
4. Use this build command:

```bash
npm install && npm run build
```

5. Set the publish directory to:

```text
dist
```

6. Add this environment variable:

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - the URL of your deployed backend Web Service

7. Deploy the static site.

## 5. Configure SPA routing

The frontend uses `BrowserRouter`, so direct refreshes on routes like `/dashboard` or `/admin` need an SPA rewrite.

In the Render Static Site settings, add a rewrite rule:

- Source: `/*`
- Destination: `/index.html`
- Action: `Rewrite`

## 6. Verify frontend-backend connectivity

1. Visit the frontend URL.
2. Register a patient account.
3. Log in as a patient and open the dashboard, analytics, schedules, chat, and help pages.
4. Log in as an admin and open the admin dashboard, reports, settings, and audit logs.
5. Confirm that API calls succeed in the browser network tab.

## 7. Update CORS when URLs change

If you change the frontend URL, update `FRONTEND_ORIGINS` on the backend and redeploy the backend.

Examples:

```text
FRONTEND_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.onrender.com
FRONTEND_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.onrender.com,https://your-preview-domain.onrender.com
```

## 8. Common issues

- CORS error in the browser: add the frontend URL to `FRONTEND_ORIGINS` and redeploy the backend.
- Blank page on refresh: the Static Site rewrite rule is missing.
- Login or registration fails immediately: `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is pointing at the wrong backend URL.
- Database-related 500 errors: run `alembic upgrade head` against the database you actually use, whether Neon or Render.
- Database-related 500 errors: run `alembic upgrade head` against the database you actually use, whether Neon or Render.
- OCR or SMS features fail: the Azure or Twilio environment variables are missing.

## 9. Useful repository files

- Backend app entrypoint: `backend/app/main.py`
- Backend environment template: `backend/.env.example`
- Frontend entrypoint: `frontend/src/main.jsx`
- Frontend API helpers: `frontend/src/utils/adminApi.js`, `frontend/src/utils/userApi.js`

## 10. Recommended deployment order

1. Decide whether you will keep Neon or move to Render PostgreSQL.
1. Decide whether you will keep Neon or move to Render PostgreSQL.
2. Deploy the backend Web Service.
3. Run Alembic migrations.
4. Deploy the frontend Static Site.
5. Add the frontend URL to `FRONTEND_ORIGINS`.
6. Re-deploy the backend.
7. Test both patient and admin flows end to end.
